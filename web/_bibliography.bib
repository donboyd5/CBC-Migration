  abstract = {While the current housing market remains relatively strong, with housing prices setting records, concerns are growing of a potential housing bubble similar to that of 2007\textendash 2009; this paper compares the current housing market environment with that of 2007\textendash 2009 and concludes that the many of the factors that caused the 2007\textendash 2009 crisis do not exist today. Factors associated with subprime mortgages, poor and non-existent underwriting loan requirements, weak regulatory oversight, exaggerated credit ratings, under-capitalization in the banking sector and excessive speculative activity in the housing market have been addressed by regulation, which is aimed at preventing another financial crisis similar to 2007\textendash 2009. Equally important, major fundamental factors affecting real estate valuation are providing support for the housing market and housing prices; these factors are impacting both the demand and supply side of the housing market. The factors include the lack of inventories of homes available for sale, the underproduction of housing, decreased household mobility limiting supply and the increase in housing demand from millennials and institutional investors; these fundamental factors were not evident during the 2007\textendash 2009 period. Despite a number of indicators signaling a potential topping out and overvaluation of housing prices, the authors conclude that the fundamental factors will limit the extent that the housing market weakens over the next few years.},

  abstract = {A recent Spanish tax reform granted regions the authority to set income tax rates, resulting in substantial tax differentials. We use individual-level information from Social Security records over a period of one decade. Conditional on moving, taxes have a significant effect on location choice. A one percent increase in the net-of-tax rate for a region relative to others increases the probability of moving to that region by 1.7 percentage points. Focusing on the stock of top-taxpayers, we estimate an elasticity of the number of top taxpayers with respect to net-of-tax rates of 0.85. Using this elasticity, a theoretical model implies that the mechanical increase in tax revenue due to higher tax rates is larger than the loss in tax revenue from the out-flow of migration.},

Our cross-country comparisons control for age, gender, education, and industry and treat the U.S. mean as the baseline. We find, first, that WFH averages 1.5 days per week in our sample, ranging widely across countries. Second, employers plan an average of 0.7 WFH days per week after the pandemic, but workers want 1.7 days. Third, employees value the option to WFH 2-3 days per week at 5 percent of pay, on average, with higher valuations for women, people with children and those with longer commutes. Fourth, most employees were favorably surprised by their WFH productivity during the pandemic. Fifth, looking across individuals, employer plans for WFH levels after the pandemic rise strongly with WFH productivity surprises during the pandemic. Sixth, looking across countries, planned WFH levels rise with the cumulative stringency of government-mandated lockdowns during the pandemic. We draw on these results to explain the big shift to WFH and to consider some implications for workers, organization, cities, and the pace of innovation.},

  abstract = {High-income business service workers dominate the economies of major US cities, and their spending supports many local consumer service jobs. As a result, business services' high remote work potential poses a risk to consumer service workers who could lose an essential source of revenue if business service workers left big cities to work from elsewhere. We use the COVID-19-induced increase in remote work to provide empirical evidence for this mechanism and its role in shaping the pandemic's economic impact. Our findings have broader implications for the distributional consequences of the transition to more remote work. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The recent pandemic provides some insights into what a transition towards more remote work may look like. First, if the COVID-19 experience serves as a guide, the transition will be most disruptive in the densest US cities. These cities employ the largest shares of workers able to work remotely, but at the same time are the most expensive places to live. As workplace-proximity considerations become less central to residential decisions, these cities stand to lose part of their workforce. Second, the worker-level impact of the transition will be heterogeneous. High-skill service workers gain flexibility in their residential choices. The resulting changes in residential choices of high-income earners may endanger the economic livelihood of less educated service workers in big cities who depend on local consumer services demand. As a result, big cities may not only lose their high-skill service workers, but also the local consumer service economies these workers support. A more hopeful implication is that the transition to remote work could alleviate the pressure on big cities' housing markets (see Couture et al., 2019). During the pandemic, SSS workers demonstrated a high willingness and ability to relocate, and big cities' rents declined substantially in response. Encouraging some of these workers to move more permanently could help reduce rents in city centers. The future geography of work and residence will depend on whether the advantages of modern cities are primarily productive or in the quality of life they provide. In the former case, we could expect the prominence of large cities to diminish as remote work becomes feasible, whereas in the latter case, large and consumption-rich cities like New York are likely to continue to thrive. Using the continued aftermath of the COVID-induced remote work shock to distinguish between the drivers of urban concentration provides an interesting avenue for future research.},

In view of this projection, we consider some implications of home internet access quality, exploiting data from the new Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes. Moving to high quality, fully reliable home internet service for all Americans (``universal access'') would raise earnings-weighted labor productivity by an estimated 1.1\% in the coming years. The implied output gains are \$160 billion per year, or \$4 trillion when capitalized at a 4\% rate. Estimated flow output payoffs to universal access are nearly three times as large in economic disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our survey data also say that subjective well-being was higher during the pandemic for people with better home internet service conditional on age, employment status, earnings, working arrangements, and other controls. In short, universal access would raise productivity, and it would promote greater economic and social resilience during future disasters that inhibit travel and in-person interactions.},

Our data imply a cumulative wage-growth moderation of 2.0 percentage points over two years. This moderation offsets more than half the real-wage catchup effect that Blanchard (2022) highlights in his analysis of nearterm inflation pressures. The amenity-values gains associated with the recent rise of remote work also lower labor's share of national income by 1.1 percentage points. In addition, the ``unexpected compression'' of wages since early 2020 (Autor and Dube, 2022) is partly explained by the same amenity-value effect, which operates differentially across the earnings distribution.},

  abstract = {Lower state income taxation is shown to be associated with higher net taxpayer migration\textemdash a relationship that grows stronger with income. Since the passage of the 2017 tax reform, which increased the costs associated with state and local taxation by limiting the SALT deduction, taxpayers and earnings potential have both migrated to lower-taxing states at a faster rate. The corresponding fiscal competition coupled with state budget surpluses has motivated several states to reduce taxes\textemdash{} particularly income taxes. Although lower state income taxation is associated with heightened migration rates, this relationship could be driven by other factors correlated with state fiscal policies. This was particularly true in the late stages of the pandemic, when several states diverged in COVID-19 mitigation efforts, such as vaccine mandates. For example, of the nine states that do not levy an income tax, eight of them (with the exception of Washington) did not implement a state vaccine mandate on businesses, and several even passed legislation prohibiting localities and businesses from mandating vaccines.12 Conversely, of the four states that levied the highest state income taxes, only Hawaii did not implement a state vaccine mandate on businesses. This example highlights the possibility that state-level responses to the pandemic could be correlated with state fiscal policies in a way that influenced migration decisions. The relationship between state income taxation and migration was shown to strengthen after the implementation of the SALT cap. As a result, some might infer that the SALT cap caused harm to high-tax states, disproportionately affecting them relative to other states. The corollary to this claim, however, is that the unfettered SALT deduction only existed to benefit high-tax states. As the SALT deduction debate grows in the coming years with new proposals and the pending expiration of the corresponding TCJA provisions in 2025, researchers will have to determine whether the pre-TCJA fiscal environment ever offered a proper base scenario, or whether a fiscal environment without any SALT deduction is the natural base case. By choosing the latter, the results of this study could be interpreted as the U.S. fiscal system's natural environment, whereby the benefits of implementing state and local taxes are properly paired with the costs. From that perspective, any increase in the SALT cap would affect state tax consequences in a way that would likely distort migration rates in favor of high-tax states. Consequently, policymakers must consider how future reforms to the SALT deduction may distort domestic migration rates.},

We present four main findings. First, while overall levels of remote work are high, there is considerable variation across industries. The Dingel and Neiman (2020) measure of suitability for remote work does a remarkably good job of predicting the industry level patterns of remote work - highlighting the challenge of moving many industries to remote work. Second, remote work is much more common in industries with better educated and better paid workers. Third, in our larger survey, employers think that there has been less productivity loss from remote working in better educated and higher paid industries. Fourth, more than one-third of firms that had employees switch to remote work believe that remote work will remain more common at their company even after the COVID-19 crisis ends.},

We develop evidence on five reasons for this large shift: better-than-expected WFH experiences, new investments in physical and human capital that enable WFH, greatly diminished stigma associated with WFH, lingering concerns about crowds and contagion risks, and a pandemic-driven surge in technological innovations that support WFH. We also use our survey data to project three consequences: First, employees will enjoy large benefits from greater remote work, especially those with higher earnings. Second, the shift to WFH will directly reduce spending in major city centers by at least 5-10 percent relative to the pre-pandemic situation. Third, our data on employer plans and the relative productivity of WFH imply a 5 percent productivity boost in the post-pandemic economy due to re-optimized working arrangements. Only one-fifth of this productivity gain will show up in conventional productivity measures, because they do not capture the time savings from less commuting.},

  abstract = {\textbullet{}	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) capped state and local tax (SALT) deductions against federal income taxes, effectively raising state and local (S\&L) taxes and increasing incentives for high-income households to relocate to low-tax states. More recently, two proposed policy changes\textemdash a lifting of the cap on SALT deductions, and state income tax increases on high earners\textemdash have revived questions about whether S\&L tax increases induce migration from high- to low-tax states, and how such moves might affect S\&L budgets. \textbullet{}	The incentives to migrate for tax reasons can be quite large\textemdash for example, the TCJA's cap on S\&L tax deductions effectively raised total taxes on top earners in California and New York by over 4pp, to as much as 12pp more than they would pay in states without income taxes. Consistent with prior academic studies, we find small increases in population outflows from high-tax to low-tax states after the SALT deduction cap went into effect. \textbullet{}	Of course, tax-based migration incentives were largest for high-earning households, and IRS tax filings by income levels suggest that around 1.5\% of households earning over \$1M moved to low-tax states after the SALT deduction cap was introduced, relative to the prior trend. Furthermore, trends in New York resident and non-resident tax filings suggest that over 5\% of households earning over \$10M per year left the state due to the SALT deduction cap. \textbullet{}	We estimate that the SALT deduction cap lowered tax revenues in high-tax states by up to 1\% due to tax revenue declines from emigration. Although revenue increases in lower-tax states that experienced more in-migration partially offset these declines, we estimate that aggregate S\&L tax revenues declined by just under 0.5\% due to the SALT deduction cap. \textbullet{}	Looking ahead, our baseline assumption is that Congress will raise the cap on SALT deductions to \$50k, which should slow but not reverse the recent tax-driven migration. However, tax hikes on high-income households like the one that recently passed in New York will likely increase emigration from high-tax areas. After modeling the New York tax change, we estimate that the loss from emigration will offset about 30\% of the revenue increase from higher taxes, although the post-pandemic uncertainty is large and skewed to the higher side.},

  abstract = {Prior to the pandemic, net domestic migration in the United States had been increasing in smaller urban areas while declining in larger urban areas. The biggest factor pushing people away from the largest urban areas was likely a higher cost of living. Small and medium urban areas were net beneficiaries, as more people moved to places that had less congestion but the employment opportunities and amenities they desired. The disruptions of the pandemic appear to have accelerated these trends. Overall movement between urban areas actually increased during the pandemic, though not all areas experienced a net increase in migration. The largest net gains occurred in small and medium urban areas at the expense of very large urban areas, indicating people left these areas at an even higher rate. Despite increasing migration out of the largest urban areas, the factors that help explain differences in net migration between urban areas did not change much during the initial quarters of the pandemic. As a result, trends in domestic migration between areas will likely revert to previous trends as the pandemic fades. Given the growing importance of knowledge-based service sectors in larger urban areas, it will be difficult for small urban areas to continue to have larger net gains in migration. That equilibrium will likely be determined by the advantages of more flexible work arrangements versus higher labor productivity in larger urban areas.},

The 2004 ``millionaires' tax'' raised New Jersey's marginal income tax rate from 6.37 percent to 8.97 percent on incomes over US\$500,000. YV reported that the tax change apparently had no effect on net out-migration of affected taxpayers (relative to other affluent taxpayers); however, this result appears to be due to their modeling New Jersey out-migration and in-migration simultaneously to determine net migration effects. Correcting for this, we find a statistically significant increase in the out-migration of taxpayers making over US\$500,000 of roughly eighty per year in the years following the tax change. Given that the increase likely spurred out-migration in groups not directly taxed and discouraged in-migration, our estimates may understate the actual impact of the tax on New Jersey net out-migration.},

Since July 2021, USPS data has shown an estimated net gain of 6,332 permanent movers, indicating a gradual return to New York City, mainly in neighborhoods that experienced the greatest flight. On a per-capita basis, the largest net gains over the summer were in Chelsea/Midtown, Murray Hill/Gramercy, Battery Park City/Greenwich Village, and Chinatown/Lower East Side. In more recent months, the reopening of office buildings, the return of in-person school, and the rebirth of arts and entertainment have helped to attract movers to the city. Nonetheless, certain neighborhoods have a long road ahead to regain pre-pandemic population. Whether or not these gains continue and accelerate will depend on the trajectory of the pandemic and the city's ability to maintain in-person activities and attractions, as well as the endurance of telework arrangements and workers' ability and desire to live farther from their place of work as commuting becomes less burdensome.},

Combining the BRS, the OEWS, and the QCEW, we impute teleworking take-up rates for the universe of business establishments in the U.S, for the period immediately preceding the pandemic and for the the summer of 2021. We predict a firm's decision to relocate or downsize based on whether teleworking by its employees has increased. Increased teleworking results in a reduction in local foot traffic when the number of workers who stop commuting out of the area is smaller than the number workers who no longer commute into an area. Combining information in the ACS about residence with our teleworking estimates for the universe of establishments, we estimate the change in net traffic inflow for every zip code. Armed with these estimates and the QCEW, we then estimate the consequent effects on local employment in the various industries. The negative impact of a reduction in Census track foot traffic was especially strong for employment in accommodation and food services We conclude our analysis by bringing in Zillow data to analyze the effect that the changes brought on by increased working at home has on local rents and home prices. The key explanatory variables in the estimated equations for rents and home prices are predictions by zip code for firm relocations, firm downsizing, and the change in net foot traffic inflow.},

By following the mobility pattern of residents in gentrifying neighborhoods in 39 major U.S. cities, we note a larger increase of 1.2 percentage points in the outmigration rate from gentrifying neighborhoods by the end of 2021, relative to nongentrifying ones, with out-of-city moves accounting for over 71 percent of the increased flight. The share of out-of-city moves into gentrifying neighborhoods also decreased significantly during the pandemic. Residents with high credit scores, younger residents, and probable homeowners were more likely to leave gentrifying neighborhoods and their respective cities. Gentrifying neighborhoods closer to city centers, with higher density or higher housing costs, or in cities that are more vulnerable to the pandemic were hit harder by COVID-induced adjustments. The results are consistent with the contention that the pandemic has slowed the pace of gentrification in many major U.S. cities. This slowed gentrification has important policy implications for local government public finance, as well as the long-term future of cities.},

Low income households reasons for moving are relatively unchanged. Among the pandemic-induced movers, over 15\% of households are citing remote work as the reason the pandemic has influenced their moves and this proportion has remained steady through 2021. Our results have implications for many outcomes of interest including the future structure of cities, the persistence of remote work arrangements, municipal financing, and real estate.},

The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program's (PEP) 2020 Vintage estimated the city's population at just under 8.3 million in 2020, a modest increase from 2010. These estimates have been called into question, given that the 2020 Census enumerated the population at just over 8.8 million, well above the PEP estimate. Intercensal estimates from Cornell's Program on Applied Demographics (PAD) smooth PEP's estimated population trajectory to be in line with both the 2010 and 2020 Census enumerations. PAD's estimates indicate rapid growth early in the decade followed by roughly flat population change in the second half of the decade. These intercensal estimates are consistently higher than those produced by PEP's 2020 Vintage.  For decades, New York City has experienced net domestic outflows, including during the decade 2010-2020. Despite these outflows, New York City's population has grown through natural increase and international immigration The Covid-19 pandemic led to anomalous, short-term changes to population trends in New York City. Increases in domestic outflows, slowed immigration, increases in deaths, and declines in births contributed to a large population decline in the year after the onset of the pandemic Indicators point toward a return to pre-pandemic population trends by mid-2021.

Over half (36) of the counties in New York lost population due to migration since the last Census. However, in the most recent year (July 2020-2021), both the Capital and North Country regions experienced positive net domestic migration (more people moving in than out within the U.S.). Almost half (30) of the counties in New York experienced positive net domestic migration during this period. New York City lost almost 350 thousand people between July 2020 and 2021 due to outflow from the city into other domestic locations. The remaining seven regions also lost population due to net domestic migration in the most recent year, but these losses were less sizeable than they have been in past estimates.

Domestic migration dropped sharply in New York City from the levels reported in previous periods.

First, within large US cities, households and businesses have moved from the dense central business districts (CBDs) towards lower density suburban zip-codes. We label this the ``Donut Effect'' reflecting the movement of activity out of city centers to the suburban ring. Second, while this observed reallocation occurs within cities, we do not see major reallocation across cities. That is, there is less evidence for large-scale movement of activity from large US cities to smaller regional cities or towns. We rationalize these findings by noting that working patterns post pandemic will be primarily hybrid, with workers commuting to their business premises typically 3 days per week. This level of commuting is less than pre-pandemic, making suburbs relatively more popular, but too frequent to allow employees to leave the cities containing their employer.},

Drawing on the universe of California income tax filings, we present new findings about the effects of personal income taxation on household location choice and pre-tax income. On the extensive margin, an additional 0.8\% of the California residential tax filing base whose 2012 income would have been in the new top tax bracket were no longer full year residents of California in 2013, relative to a baseline departure rate of 1.5\%. To identify the intensive-margin impact of the California tax policy shift on the pre-tax earnings of high-income California residents who remain, we make use of high-earning out-of-state taxpayers who persistently file as California non-residents as a control sample. Using a synthetic difference-in-differences strategy, we estimate an intensive margin elasticity of income with respect to the marginal tax rate of 2.6-3.0.

  abstract = {The five boroughs of New York City (NYC) were early epicenters of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, with over 380,000 cases by May 31. High caseloads were also seen in nearby counties in New Jersey (NJ), Connecticut (CT) and New York (NY). The pandemic started in the area in March with an exponential rise in the number of daily cases, peaked in early April, briefly declined, and then, showed clear signs of a second peak in several counties.  We will show that despite control measures such as lockdown and restriction of movement during the exponential rise in daily cases, there was a significant net migration of households from NYC boroughs to the neighboring counties in NJ, CT and NY State. We propose that the second peak in daily cases in these counties around NYC was due, in part, to the movement of people from NYC boroughs to these counties. We estimate the movement of people using ``Change of Address'' (CoA) data from the US Postal Service, provided under the ``Freedom of Information Act'' of 1967. To identify the timing of the second peak and the number of cases in it, we use a previously proposed SIR model, which accurately describes the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in European countries. Subtracting the model fits from the data identified, we establish the timing and the number of cases, NCS, in the second peak. We then related the number of cases in the second peak to the county population density, P, and the excess Change of Address, ECoA, into each county using the simple model NCS\textasciitilde P{$\alpha$}EC{$\beta$}oA which fits the data very well with  = 0.68,  = 0.31 (R2 = 0.74, p = 1.3e-8). We also find that the time between the first and second peaks was proportional to the distance of the county seat from NY Penn Station, suggesting that this migration of households and disease was a directed flow and not a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a simple method to use change of address data to track the spread of an infectious agent, such as SARS-Cov-2, due to migrations away from epicenters during the initial stages of a pandemic.},

Some of the fastest-growing cities before the pandemic grew at a much slower rate after it started, changing the rankings among the top 15 gainers. While many rankings of cities and towns remained roughly the same, there were notable differences in the magnitudes of change. The new estimates show that some fast-growing cities in 2019 grew at a slower rate in 2021. At the same time, others grew at a faster pace during the pandemic. Overall, growth slowed in the nation's biggest cities and some states experienced an uptick in population due to migration to the South and West in the first year after the pandemic hit.},

Urban populations have also become more educated and well to do.

A large portion of all economic growth today accrues to the top one percent of income earners. Modest millionaire taxes at the state level are prudent ways to address growing income inequality in America, as well as providing revenues for public services and investments in people. These taxes come with little risk of millionaire tax flight. These taxes are largely paid by the late-career working rich, who are embedded in their states for a host of social, family, and economic reasons. Moving is a young person's game, but earning top incomes is most common among professionals at the very peaks of their careers, tied to place by their employers, clients, families, and rich social networks that are not easy to move.},

  abstract = {Taxing the rich is one of the central debates in this era of rising inequality. Elite taxation can alleviate income disparities and fund public investments. Yet, if top earners engage in tax flight, moving from high-tax to low-tax places, redistributive goals suffer as the tax base erodes. The incentive for tax flight, however, is counterbalanced by elite embeddedness \textendash{} socio-economic ties to places where the rich became successful. To understand how tax incentives and embeddedness shape millionaire tax flight, we study two large-scale natural experiments. First, historic federal tax reform in 2017 changed incentives to favor lower-tax states, and tax flight was widely predicted. Second, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted local embeddedness for those who could work remotely. We study these unique shocks using administrative data on top earners from IRS tax returns. We find that millionaires overall are highly embedded in their states, but there is a small ``anomic elite'' with few ties to place and high mobility. Tax reform had small effects on millionaire migration, implying the viability of high taxes on the rich. Finally, the pandemic reduced elite attachment to place, raising questions about the future of work-from-home policies and their potential impact on the geography of the elite.},

  abstract = {Top income earners often face incentives to move to lower tax places, but at the same time may be rooted in the communities where they become successful. High tax places rely on elite embeddedness to retain their wealthy taxpayers and the revenues they bring. Low tax places hope that financial incentives will lure the rich away. This study explores how the intersection of incentives and embeddedness affects the mobility of elites. Using big administrative data, we examine two large-scale natural experiments: the 2017 federal tax reform, which changed incentives to favor lower-tax states; and the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted social ties to place. We show that both these events led to millionaire tax flight. However, the effects are small and demonstrate that, at least in the short run, embeddedness remains a powerful force that helps sustain the viability of taxes on the rich.},

Drawing on unique state tax micro-data, we estimate the migration response of millionaires to the rate increase, using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. The results indicate little responsiveness, with semi-elasticities generally below 0.1. Tax-induced migration is estimated to be higher among people of retirement age, people living on investment income rather than wages, and people who work (and pay tax) entirely in-state. The tax is estimated to raise \$1 billion per year and modestly reduce income inequality.},

  abstract = {A growing number of U.S. states have adopted ``millionaire taxes'' on top income-earners. This increases the progressivity of state tax systems, but it raises concerns about tax flight: elites migrating from high-tax to low-tax states, draining state revenues, and undermining redistributive social policies. Are top income-earners ``transitory millionaires'' searching for lower-tax places to live? Or are they ``embedded elites'' who are reluctant to migrate away from places where they have been highly successful? This question is central to understanding the social consequences of progressive taxation. We draw on administrative tax returns for all million-dollar income-earners in the United States over 13 years, tracking the states from which millionaires file their taxes. Our dataset contains 45 million tax records and provides census-scale panel data on top income-earners. We advance two core analyses: (1) state-tostate migration of millionaires over the long-term, and (2) a sharply-focused discontinuity analysis of millionaire population along state borders. We find that millionaire tax flight is occurring, but only at the margins of statistical and socioeconomic significance.},

The critical modeling choice made by CLS is to exclude the observed in-migration of millionaires in the years following the tax increase.
