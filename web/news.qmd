Bob Scardamalia sent the figure below with the following note:

> I'm attaching an historical graphic of age specific migration for Manhattan. It clearly shows that some demographic forces apply through both good and bad economic cycles. While Manhattan is an exceptional example, it's not the only one that shows very distinct and stable patterns of age-related migration...It comes out of long-time work of the Pop Center at the Univ of Wisc-Madison. Public website and the citation is at the bottom. It's available for all counties in the US and I can pull together ones of interest to the group.
